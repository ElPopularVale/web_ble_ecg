This Web BLE ECG app is written in TypeScript and is used to colorfully animate a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) from a custom made Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE or Bluetooth 4.0+) acquisition hardware. The signal is animated in HTML5 Canvas and is responsive to the client's screen size. The custom hardware used with this app has the following GATT structure:

1 ECG Service UUID: 0x805b

8 Characteristics:
Lead I = Channel 1 UUID: 0x8171
Lead II = Channel 2 UUID: 0x8172
Lead V1 = Channel 3 UUID: 0x8173
Lead V2 = Channel 4 UUID: 0x8174
Lead V3 = Channel 5 UUID: 0x8175
Lead V4 = Channel 6 UUID: 0x8176
Lead V5 = Channel 7 UUID: 0x8177
Lead V6 = Channel 8 UUID: 0x8178

All characteristics must support sending notifications. Leads III, aVR, aVF, and aVL can be calculated from I and II.

Each GATT notification from each channel contains 21 samples of 24 bits, 250 Hz sampling rate data in 2's complement, which are converted to signed 32-bit numbers. Webpack is used for compilation and packing. This app has been tested in Chrome Beta version 84.0.4147.38 (64 bits) and node.js v8.

HOW IT WORKS

When the ECG device is turned on, it's in advertising mode so that the Web Bluetooth API can discover it. Run npm install and open index.html in the dist/ folder. In the web page, click the "Connect" button. Find your device from the list and click "Pair." Once successfully connected, the app will start automatically displaying the live signal of all leads.
